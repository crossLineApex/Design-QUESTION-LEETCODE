# Design-QUESTION-LEETCODE

Just Got Bored and came across some super fun Design questions on Leetcode which interviewers skip for god knows what reason.

So here I'm willing to do those questions starting with Linked List Design Questions
Also the challenge in Linked List questions or linked list as  general is always trying to modify the list and not create a new modified list. Never go the easy way heehahaha... with menacing tone
